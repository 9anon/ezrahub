    <h2>About Ezra Hub</h2>
    <p>So is this your first time coming across Ezra Hub? A lot of people want to know what Ezra Hub is all about, how we got started, who we are and what we represent. We've created this page to help answer your questions and to show you that we're just a chill group of guys and girls like you! We'd love to share the success story of Ezra Hub and we hope you share it with your friends, too!</p>
    <h3>Some cool facts about how we started</h3>
    <p>Though almost 3/4 of our visitors have been browsing the website for at least three months, not everyone was around at the beginning. To help you get an idea of what things were like in the old days, we'll share a bit about how we started. We'll start you off with a couple cool factoids about our humble beginnings:</p>
    <h4>The Dawn of Man: Ezra Hub's Humble Beginnings</h2>

    <p>Cornell Hub (now Ezra Hub) was created on October 14, 2011 somewhere around 2:00am by an enterprising young sophomore mechanical engineer and a junior biology major. The first post was a rude joke from the former to the latter about fellatio. The first ban issued was from the latter to the former... and thus Ezra Hub was begun. Within our first week, we had served up over 50,000 page views with 98% of them being from Cornell's own RedRover network. Not a bad start...</p>
    <p>The now-defunct <a target="_blank" href="http://cornellhub.com">cornellhub.com</a> domain name was purchased on October 28, 2011 for about 7 dollars with the GoDaddy.com discount code "LINUX". Cornell Hub was thereby born. Before then, we were just <a target="_blank" href="tinyurl.com/cornellhub">tinyurl.com/cornellhub</a> and we never thought of making Cornell Hub a permanent project.</p>

    <h4>Web Design Not Even Once</h4>

        <p class="caption">Absolutely disgusting web design: Exhibit A</p>
    </div>
    <p>Our initial success was completely by word-of-mouth and probably not hugely based on the quality of the website. The homepage looked like this:</p>
    <p>Pretty old, huh? We were originally "CornellHub" with one word, but since about the second month we've been two words. Many people still confuse this and call the current Ezra Hub "Ezrahub" or "EzraHub," though this is incorrect.</p>
    <p>We fully admit that we have absolutely no web design experience when we first started Ezra Hub, and it took us quite a while to figure out how to install phpMyAdmin. We've come a long way since then.</p>

    <h4>An Old Amazon.com Box</h4>

    <p>When Cornell Hub served up it's first page view, it was hosted on a Pentium 4 machine running Debian 6.0 Squeeze with 1GB of RAM. It lived in a Amazon.com cardboard box that was found in a garbage chute and was located under a dorm-room bed. Cornell Hub also wore hipster thick-rimmed glasses and a tan fedora from Australia, with a smiley face drawn on one side of the box. Cornell's top-notch bandwidth also helped us out a <em>bit</em>.</p>
    <p>Somewhere around a month after initial launch, the administrators noticed the first random Cornellian browsing the site with it's distinctive red banner in the library. They knew they had started something big. Several other students were recruited to pool their efforts and grow the site. Now, Ezra Hub sometimes serves up 50,000 page views <em>daily</em>.</p>
    <div class="clear both"></div>
    <h3>Why did our name change?</h3>
    <p>On June 6, 2012, Cornell Hub received an email from Mike Powers, Senior Director of University Communications, instructing us to shut down the website with the grounds being illegal use of the "Cornell" name and that they had noticed the notorious Racist Spammer (see the memes page) in action. Several posters suspected that a member of the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority had gone to the administration and complained about the site, especially after her application to be a moderator had been denied and her sorority had suffered negative publicity on the website (all moderated sufficiently and appropriately. Additionally, Phi Sigma Sigma is a protected organization on the Discussion Board). Regarding the email, a similar one had been sent to a popular but critical blog written by Elliott Back '06 five years earlier (<a target="_blank" href="http://cornell.elliottback.com/cornell-university-nastygram/">http://cornell.elliottback.com/cornell-university-nastygram/</a>). At the onset, the administrators considered shuttering the website for good, but the userbase lamented this decision and hoped that Cornell Hub would stay. To avoid us -- a couple of poor college students with mountains of student loans like everyone else -- having to spend time in court with Cornell's high-powered legal team and also to support our user base, the entire website had been moved to http://ezrahub.com within 6 hours and every use of the Cornell name on every page had been changed. After a phone conversation with Mr. Powers discussing the matter and with a promise to call back to notify us of further legal action, Ezra Hub has not heard from Mr. Powers since. Ezra Hub is not and never has been endorsed by Cornell University in any way and our legal page has stated this since the very beginning.</p>
    <p>We are quite happy with our new name, it has caught on in the Cornell community, and traffic has increased since the change. After this incident, Ezra Hub recruited a few more moderators to handle an increased volume of distasteful content due to the Racist Spammer. Later on we would embarrass the University much further with incidents like this:</p>

    <h3>Who are we and what do we do?</h3>
    <p>Since October 2011, we have drawn upon our initial success and come a long way to what we are today. It's been a long, sometimes stressful and always fun ride. We started as two members and we currently draw from a larger group of students who contribute frequently or infrequently, depending on how much work they have to do. Ezra Hub is a community effort and we all work together. We currently capture about 15-20% of the Cornell student body on a daily basis, and about 40% of the student body weekly (which is pretty good!). Ezra Hub is maintained by a small group of Cornell students across several years and majors who do it simply for fun and experience. A lot of us are very skilled, but sometimes we feel like this:</p>

    </div>
    <p>Ezra Hub is an educational opportunity. We serve no ads, do not make money and essentially operate at a very small loss every month. We have never asked our users for money and the service is completely open to anyone. We also enjoy developing the site to learn more about web development and hone our development skills.</p>
    <p>Some of us moderate the discussion board, some us develop new functionality, some of us work on the look and feel of the website and others do the technical and server-administration aspects. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p>We spend most of our time working on homework and studying for classes. Ezra Hub is just for fun.</p>
