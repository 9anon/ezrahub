    <h2>Our Simple Set of Rules</h2>
    <p>If you use a little common sense it's pretty easy to figure out what you are allowed and not allowed to post. For those who just don't get it, here it is spelled out for you. Please note that by posting on Ezra Hub you agree that any post any of the moderators deem inappropriate may be removed at the moderator's sole discretion. Use of Ezra Hub is a privilege, not a right. Ezra Hub moderators and administrators also have the right, at their sole discretion, to revoke board privileges at any time without notice for infractions.</p>
    <h3>The following is allowed under every circumstance:</h3>
    <div class="rule allowed">
        <h4>Quality, insightful, thoughtful, constructive posts.</h4>
        <p>Please help make Ezra Hub a nice place where people come to read great content every day!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>The following are not allowed under any circumstance:</h3>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Personal attacks, internet-bullying, invasions of individual privacy, slander, libel, nasty things about other people etc.</h4>
        <p>You may talk about fellow Cornellians by name so long as you are not being offensive, attacking them, attempting to bring them down or invading their personal privacy. We at Ezra Hub are students ourselves and we will do whatever we can to protect fellow students from unwarranted attacks. You are expected to treat other forum members as you would like to be treated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Gratuitous racism, anti-semitism, homophobia, hate speech, slut shaming etc.</h4>
        <p>Self-explanatory and very easy to recognize. This type of content is not welcome anywhere on Ezra Hub, no matter what. Ezra Hub is an inclusive community and members of all races, sexual orientations, religions or other affiliations are welcome to post or read. If you want to express your outdated views, please do so somewhere else.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Content that breaks US law or any content instructing others to break the law</h4>
        <p>This rule is also self-explanatory. Anything that would be illegal in the United States is also not welcome on Ezra Hub. The moderators will delete any content that violates the law or that instructs users on how to break the law.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Porn</h4>
        <p>Don't post porn. You know what porn is and this isn't the place for it. There are plenty of other places on the internet to view pornographic material and you are welcome to do so elsewhere. Please do not post naked pictures of other people without their express permission or if you are violating state or federal law. <strong>Clarification for nitpicking fratstars:</strong> you may post pictures of bare buttocks (of either sex), however photos of genitalia (both penises and vaginas) or breasts are prohibited. Photographs of individuals engaging in sexual acts are also prohibited. You may post a picture of Michaelangelo's David.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Spamming, repeatedly posting the same topic, abusing the account registration system, unwarranted advertising etc.</h4>
        <p>Self-explanatory. If there is already another thread on the exact same topic, please post in that thread instead of creating your own. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule not-allowed">
        <h4>Arguing with the moderators and being an edgy fratstar</h4>
        <p>All deletions and bans are non-negotiable and will not be discussed. Ezra Hub is policed by students like you who have things to do besides argue about inane crap and are doing their best to keep the site tasteful and enjoyable for everyone. Breaking this rule warrants an immediate kick in the balls and/or ban.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>All deletions and bans will be non-negotiable.</h3>
    <p>We can't stress this enough. Don't ask us. Just pull yourself away from the computer screen and come back another time. Ezra Hub is not a "fair" community where you can bring your complaint about being banned to the court of law and the moderators are just trying to do their job. If you get banned, too bad, just come back later with a new attitude.</p>
    <h3>Terms of Use:</h3>
    <p>By posting on this website <strong>you are acknowledging that you have read and agree to the following:</strong></p>
    <p>Ezra Hub contains certain discussion forums, threads, chat areas, news groups, communities and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively, "communities").

Ezra Hub has no responsibility for such content and is merely providing access to such content as a service to you. By their very nature, communities may carry offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. We expect that you will use caution and common sense and exercise proper judgment when using communities. You agree that any post the moderators consider inappropriate may be removed at the moderators' sole discretion. Ezra Hub also has the right, at its sole discretion, to revoke board privileges at any time without notice for infractions.
